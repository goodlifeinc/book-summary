# The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers

## Chapter 1: Professionalism

1. Professionalism

    **Professionalism is all about taking responsibility.**

    If a nonprofessional makes an error, the employer cleans up the mess. But when a professional makes a mistake, he cleans up the mess.

2. Do not create bugs

    In order to be professional, we must not create bugs. The fact that the task to write perfect software is virtually impossible does not mean you aren’t responsible for the imperfection.

3. Learn to apologize

    But first thing you must practice is apologizing. **Apologies are necessary**, but insufficient. You cannot keep making the same errors over and over. As you mature in your profession, you error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero.

4. Do not release faulty code to the QAs

    When you release your software its unprofessional to purposely send code that you know to be faulty and expect the QAs to find problems. And what code do you know to be faulty? Any code you aren’t certain about!

    **QAs ARE NOT the bug catchers.** But will they find bugs? Probably, so get ready to apologize and then figure out why those bugs managed to escape your notice and do something to prevent it from happening again.

5. Test your code

    How can you know your code works? That’s easy. **TEST IT!!!!** Automate your tests. Write unit tests that you can execute on a moment’s notice, and run those tests as often as you can. The test coverage have to be 100%!

    Sometimes code is hard to test. But only because that code has been designed that way. The solution to that is to design your code to be easy to test. And the best way to do that is to write your tests first, before you write the code that passes them (Test Driven Development).

6. Make your code flexible

    It is the structure of your code that allows it to be flexible. Never compromise it!!!
    Change your code all the time! Every time you look at a module you make small, lightweight changes to it to improve its structure. Every time you read through the code you adjust the structure.

7. Work ethic

    **Your career is your responsibility.** It is not your employer’s responsibility to make sure you are marketable.It is not your employer’s responsibility to train you, or to send you to conferences, or to buy you books.

    It is also not your employer’s responsibility to give you the time you need to learn. 

    Work 60 hours per week. The first 40 are for your employer. The remaining 20 are for you. During this remaining 20 hours you should be reading, practicing, learning, and otherwise enhancing your career.
    
8. Know your field

    If you want to be a professional, you should know a sizable chunk of your field and constantly be increasing the size of that chunk.

    Things every developer should know:
    - design patterns
    - design principles
    - methods -> XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design
    - disciplines -> TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.
    - artifacts -> UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.

    **Read books, articles, blogs, tweets. Go to conferences. Go to user groups. Participate in reading and study groups. Learn things that are outside your comfort zone.** If you are a .NET programmer, learn Java. If you are a Java programmer, learn Ruby. If you are a C programmer, learn Lisp. If you want to really bend your brain, learn Prolog and Forth

9. Practice 

    **Exercise your skills outside of the performance of your job for the sole purpose of refining and enhancing those skills.**
    
10. Know your domain

    It is the responsibility of every software professional to **understand the domain** of the solutions they are programming.

11. Identify with your employer/customer

    Your employer’s problems are your problems. You need to understand what those problems are and work toward the best solutions. As you develop a system you need to put yourself in your employer’s shoes and make sure that the features you are developing are really going to address your employer’s needs.


**Remember:**
- take responsibility
- be ready to apologies
- NEVER ship without testing!
- QA should find nothing wrong with your code
- test your code (100% test coverage)
- adjust the structure of your code every time you read through it
- work 60 hours per week
- know your field
- practice - train your fingers and your brain with solving simple problems
- know your domain
