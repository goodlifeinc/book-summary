# The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers

## Chapter 1: Professionalism

1. Professionalism

    **Professionalism is all about taking responsibility.**

    If a nonprofessional makes an error, the employer cleans up the mess. But when a professional makes a mistake, he cleans up the mess.

2. Do not create bugs

    In order to be professional, we must not create bugs. The fact that the task to write perfect software is virtually impossible does not mean you aren’t responsible for the imperfection.

3. Learn to apologize

    But first thing you must practice is apologizing. **Apologies are necessary**, but insufficient. You cannot keep making the same errors over and over. As you mature in your profession, you error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero.

4. Do not release faulty code to the QAs

    When you release your software its unprofessional to purposely send code that you know to be faulty and expect the QAs to find problems. And what code do you know to be faulty? Any code you aren’t certain about!

    **QAs ARE NOT the bug catchers.** But will they find bugs? Probably, so get ready to apologize and then figure out why those bugs managed to escape your notice and do something to prevent it from happening again.

5. Test your code

    How can you know your code works? That’s easy. **TEST IT!!!!** Automate your tests. Write unit tests that you can execute on a moment’s notice, and run those tests as often as you can. The test coverage have to be 100%!

    Sometimes code is hard to test. But only because that code has been designed that way. The solution to that is to design your code to be easy to test. And the best way to do that is to write your tests first, before you write the code that passes them (Test Driven Development).

6. Make your code flexible

    It is the structure of your code that allows it to be flexible. Never compromise it!!!
    Change your code all the time! Every time you look at a module you make small, lightweight changes to it to improve its structure. Every time you read through the code you adjust the structure.

7. Work ethic

    **Your career is your responsibility.** It is not your employer’s responsibility to make sure you are marketable.It is not your employer’s responsibility to train you, or to send you to conferences, or to buy you books.

    It is also not your employer’s responsibility to give you the time you need to learn. 

    Work 60 hours per week. The first 40 are for your employer. The remaining 20 are for you. During this remaining 20 hours you should be reading, practicing, learning, and otherwise enhancing your career.
    
8. Know your field

    If you want to be a professional, you should know a sizable chunk of your field and constantly be increasing the size of that chunk.

    Things every developer should know:
    - design patterns
    - design principles
    - methods -> XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design
    - disciplines -> TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.
    - artifacts -> UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.

    **Read books, articles, blogs, tweets. Go to conferences. Go to user groups. Participate in reading and study groups. Learn things that are outside your comfort zone.** If you are a .NET programmer, learn Java. If you are a Java programmer, learn Ruby. If you are a C programmer, learn Lisp. If you want to really bend your brain, learn Prolog and Forth

9. Practice 

    **Exercise your skills outside of the performance of your job for the sole purpose of refining and enhancing those skills.**
    
10. Know your domain

    It is the responsibility of every software professional to **understand the domain** of the solutions they are programming.

11. Identify with your employer/customer

    Your employer’s problems are your problems. You need to understand what those problems are and work toward the best solutions. As you develop a system you need to put yourself in your employer’s shoes and make sure that the features you are developing are really going to address your employer’s needs.

**Remember:**
- take responsibility
- be ready to apologies
- NEVER ship without testing!
- QA should find nothing wrong with your code
- test your code (100% test coverage)
- adjust the structure of your code every time you read through it
- work 60 hours per week
- know your field
- practice - train your fingers and your brain with solving simple problems
- know your domain

## Chapter 2: Saying No

1. Learn to say NO

    **Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say NO to their managers.**

    Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But professionals are expected to say no. Indeed, good managers crave someone who has the guts to say no. It’s the only way you can really get anything done.

    The hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of adversarial roles.

2. Why is less important than the fact

    The why is a lot less important than the fact. Still, knowing why might help your manager to understand, and therefore to accept, the fact.

3. High stakes

    The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest. The higher the stakes, the more valuable no becomes.

4. Team player

    Being a team player means playing your position as well as you possibly can, and helping out your teammates when they get into a jam. A team-player communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her teammates, and executes his or her own responsibilities as well as possible. A team player is not someone who says yes all the time.

5. Never say "I will try"

    **There is no trying.**
    If there is extra effort she could apply, then you must not have been applying all your effort before. The promise to try is an admission that you’ve been holding back, that you have a reservoir of extra effort that you can apply. This puts the burden on you. If your “trying” does not lead to the desired outcome, you will have failed.

    By promising to try you are saying that you have a new plan. If you don’t have a new plan, if you don’t make a change to your behavior, if you do everything exactly as you would have before you promised to “try,” then what does trying mean?

    If you are not holding back some energy in reserve, if you don’t have a new plan, if you aren’t going to change your behavior, and if you are reasonably confident in your original estimate, then promising to try is fundamentally dishonest. You are lying. And you are probably doing it to save face and to avoid a confrontation.

**Remember:**
- professionals have the courage to say NO
- the time to say no is when the stakes are highest
- team player is not someone who says yes all the time
- trying actually means lying

## Chapter 3: Saying Yes

**Say. Mean. Do.**
    There are three parts to making a commitment.
    1. **You say you’ll do it.**
    2. **You mean it.**
    3. **You actually do it.**

    There are very few people who, when they say something, they mean it and then actually get it done. There are some who will say things and mean them, but they never get it done. And there are far more people who promise things and don’t even mean to do them.

    Ever heard someone say, “Man, I really need to lose some weight,” and you knew they are not going to do anything about it? It happens all the time.

    Instead of trusting our guts, we can use some language-related tricks to try and figure out if people really mean what they say. And by changing what we say, we can start taking care of steps 1 and 2 of the previous list on our own. When we say we will commit to something, and we need to mean it.

1. Recognizing lack of commitment

    Signs of noncommitment:
    - *Need\should.* “We need to get this done.” “I need to lose weight.” “Someone should make that happen.”
    - *Hope\wish.* “I hope to get this done by tomorrow.” “I hope we can meet again some day.” “I wish I had time for that.” “I wish this computer was faster.”
    - *Let’s.* (not followed by “I . . .”) “Let’s meet sometime.” “Let’s finish this thing.”

2. What does commitment sound like?

    The secret ingredient to recognizing real commitment is to look for sentences that sound like this: **I will ... by ...** (example: I will finish this by Tuesday.)

    When you use it and you say you'll do something there is only a binary result is possible - you either get it done, or you don’t. If you don’t get it done, people can hold you up to your promises. You will feel bad about not doing it. You will feel awkward telling someone about not having done it (if that someone heard you promise you will).

    Something very important is to ALWAYS commit to things that you have full control of.
    If the end goal depends on someone else, you should commit to specific actions that bring you closer to the end goal.

    If you can’t make your commitment, the most important thing is to raise a red
    flag as soon as possible to whoever you committed to. If you don’t tell anyone about the potential problem as soon as possible, you’re not giving anyone a chance to help you follow through on your commitment.

3. Learn how to say yes

    Professionals are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of them. However, they should work hard to find creative ways to make “yes” possible. When professionals say yes, they use the language of commitment so that there is no doubt about what they’ve promised.

**Remember:**
- Say. Mean. Do.
- always commit to things that you have full controll of
- if you can's make your commitment, inform the person or people whoever you committed to as soon as possible
